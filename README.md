# Readme

This repository is a bank of scripts used during my master's thesis. I don't like to write
tons of scripts, so this is mostly to have a semblance of version control so that I don't break
anything.

This code was written in a Pycharm environment using Python 3.11. It **should** be operable
in any environment.

# Topic modelling

The topic_modelling.py file contains functions to build an NLP pipeline for a corpus composed
of individual documents stored in a csv file, with 1 line = 1 document. The file is meant to be
run in the repository where the input file is stored, and assumes a document structure that is
only relevant to my way of organising things, so adapt as you need.
